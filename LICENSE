The Mint 2.1 licenses, and any licenses similar to them that have the
name "Mint" in them, are mostly copyleft licenses for the software
known as the Mint Programming Language. You may adapt this license
to your own software, as long as you do not associate that software
with the Mint Programming Language. If you have any concerns or questions
about this, feel free to contact Jiangcheng "Oliver" Chu. His contact
information is included at the bottom of this license.

This license is not actually designed for any software or product except
for the Mint Programming Language. You should take caution if you decide
to use a variant of this license to protect your own software or any
products you design.

The licenses for most software and other works or ideas are usually
supposed to take away your freedom to change or share the item in question.
However, this license resembles the GPL and GPLv3, which means it should
grant you freedom to share and change the Mint Programming Language
software.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

>>> 0. Definitions <<<
"This license" refers to the Mint 2.1 License.

"The program", "the software", and "the language" all refer to the
implementation of the Mint Programming Language.

To "modify" a piece of software means to take the files that comprise
the software, and then change any filename, any directory structure,
or change any number of bytes in any of the files in the
software folder(s).

The "original" refers to a particular piece of unmodified software
or any unmodified product.

To "distribute" means to give someone else access to the software
in question. Distribution still occurs whether you are copying the
files over to his/her disk or simply share a web address containing
the contents of the software.

The "source code" means all the hand written code created by humans that
are part of the software or required during the process of making
the software.

>>> 1. Source Code <<<
For personal use, you are free to modify the source code and also distribute
the original program that runs the Mint 2.1 Programming Language.

>>> 2. Usage <<<
For personal use, you are free to write Mint code and execute it by invoking
the Mint Java interpreter or the Mint to Python translator.

>>> 3. Business and Organizations <<<
Both for-profit and not-for-profit businesses, companies, corporations,
and organizations cannot use Mint without charge unless they get
permission from the author of Mint, Jiangcheng Chu.

>>> 4. Disclaimer of Warranty and Liability <<<
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THIS SOFTWARE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER PROVIDES THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING
ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE
WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

>>> 5. Information Not Mentioned <<<
If some information is not mentioned in this document, such as whether or
not you can create a version of Mint that simply criticizes the original
implementation of the language, you can assume that such actions are not
allowed.

For example, this license does not tell you whether or not it is okay
to blame the creator of Mint for ruining a server, simply because you
wrote Mint code that damaged the server's software infrastructure in some
way.

In this case, it is NOT okay to blame the creator of Mint for this
issue. It is your responsibility to write Mint code carefully.
If you do not do so, Mint can produce unwanted results.
Mint is a powerful programming language that can edit files, upload to
the Internet, and potentially perform dangerous actions. Take caution
when using the language and especially when editing the source code.

>>> 6. Contradictions <<<
Do not assume anything about contradictions in this license.
If some parts of the license seem contradictory, please contact the
author of this license immediately.

If you do not do so, you cannot claim the license is flawed or is
invalidated. You must talk to the person behind the license first.

You are not allowed to accept this license and use the Mint language
or its source in any way until you understand and have fully resolved
all contradictions in this license.
