The while statement is designed to do an action repeatedly. While the while statement's condition is true, it keeps executing its clause.
When the condition becomes false, it skips the clause.<br />

<pre>i = <span class="number">11</span>
<span class="keyword">while</span> i > <span class="number">0</span>
    i--
    <span class="keyword">print </span>i     <span class="comment">//Counts down from 10 to 0.</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span>
<span class="keyword">print </span><span class="string">"Done!"</span></pre>

The for statement is similar to the while statement except that it takes a different format.<br />

<pre><span class="keyword">for</span> &lt;initialization>; &lt;condition>; &lt;change>
    <span class="comment">//Clause</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span></pre>

The initialization statement is executed once before the for loop begins. The condition is checked so that the for loop can keep running (the for loop
stops running once the condition is false), and the change statement occurs every time the for loop reaches the end of its clause.<br />

<pre><span class="keyword">for</span> i = <span class="number">1</span><span class="number">0</span>; i >= <span class="number">0</span>; i--
    <span class="keyword">print </span>i    <span class="comment">//Counts down from 10 to 0</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span>
<span class="keyword">print </span><span class="string">"Done!"</span></pre>

There's a special variation of the for loop known as the for each loop, which goes across each item in an iterable. An iterable is a variable that holds a series of items, such as a list or a string. Strings are variables that hold text. Text values are enclosed in double quotes, as we've seen many times before.<br />

<pre>x = <span class="string">"hello"</span>                               <span class="comment">//This is a string.</span>
y = [<span class="number">1</span><span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">9</span>, <span class="number">8</span>, <span class="number">7</span>, <span class="number">6</span>, <span class="number">5</span>, <span class="number">4</span>, <span class="number">3</span>, <span class="number">2</span>, <span class="number">1</span>, <span class="number">0</span>]    <span class="comment">//This is a list of numbers.</span>
<span class="keyword">for</span> <span class="keyword">each</span> i <span class="keyword">of</span> y
    <span class="keyword">print </span>i     <span class="comment">//Counts down from 10 to 0.</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span>
<span class="keyword">for</span> <span class="keyword">each</span> character <span class="keyword">of</span> x
    <span class="keyword">print </span>character    <span class="comment">//Prints every character in "hello".</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span></pre>

Lists are enclosed in square brackets and have elements separated by commas. We will learn more about them later.<br /><br />

There's a simplified version of the for loop known as the repeat loop.<br />

<pre><span class="keyword">repeat</span> <span class="number">5</span>
    <span class="keyword">print </span><span class="string">"Hi"</span>   <span class="comment">//Prints Hi five times.</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span>

i = <span class="number">1</span><span class="number">0</span>
z = <span class="number">0</span>
<span class="keyword">repeat</span> i
    z++          <span class="comment">//Counts up from 1 to 10.</span>
    <span class="keyword">print </span>z
<span class="keyword">end</span></pre>

repeat &lt;number> will repeat its clause &lt;number> times. If you use a variable after the repeat keyword, the variable is not modified. Instead, the repeat loop
repeats its clause for the number of times indicated by the current value of the variable.<br /><br />

Switch statements are a special case of the if ... else if ... else construction.<br />

<pre>x = <span class="number">3</span>

<span class="keyword">switch </span>x
    <span class="keyword">case </span><span class="number">1</span>
        <span class="keyword">print </span><span class="string">"x is one."</span>
    <span class="keyword">case </span><span class="number">2</span>, <span class="number">3</span>, <span class="number">4</span>
        <span class="keyword">print </span><span class="string">"x is in the set {2, 3, 4}."</span>
    <span class="keyword">case </span><span class="number">5</span>
        <span class="keyword">print </span><span class="string">"x is five."</span>
    <span class="keyword">default</span>
        <span class="keyword">print </span><span class="string">"x is not an integer between 1 and 5."</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span></pre>

switch &lt;number> will search all cases in the switch clause for the corresponding number, and executes the corresponding case.<br />
If there are no matching cases, the default case is executed.<br />
Unlike other programming languages, in Mint cases do not "fall through", and therefore don't need to be terminated with a break statement.<br /><br />

There is also a special version of the if statement known as the conditional operator, written using a single line.
<br />
<pre>var = <span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="string">"hi"</span> == <span class="string">"hi"</span> <span class="keyword">then</span> <span class="number">100</span> <span class="keyword">else</span> <span class="number">200</span>
<span class="keyword">print</span> var    <span class="comment">//var is 100</span>
t = <span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="number">0</span> != <span class="number">0</span> <span class="keyword">then</span> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="keyword">else</span> <span class="number">2</span>
<span class="keyword">print</span> t    <span class="comment">//t is 2</span></pre>
