Mint comes with an interactive interpreter, similar to the ones that come with Python or Ruby. By default, program.mint contains a loop of code that runs the interpreter, but you are free to replace it with your own Mint program.
<br /><br />
The typical way to start with a programming language tutorial is with the Hello world program:<br />

<pre><span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">"Hello world!"</span></pre>

As you can see, in Mint printing Hello world! to the screen is very simple and only requires 1 line of code.
<br /><br />
So anyway, how do we start up the interpreter?
<br /><br />
<span class="section_title">Mint on Mac &amp; Linux</span><br />
Use the terminal to execute <code>java -jar Mint4.0.jar</code><br />
This will automatically run program.mint.
<br /><br />
If this doesn't work, you may need to find your Java installation and make sure <code>java</code> is in your PATH system variable. 
<br /><br />
<span class="section_title">Mint on Windows</span><br />
To run this program.mint on Windows, double-click on the RunMint.bat batch file to execute the Mint interpreter.
<br /><br />
If this doesn't work, you may need to find your Java installation and try to add <code>java</code> to your PATH system variable.<br />
For Windows users, Java might be installed somewhere like <code>C:/Program Files/Java/jre7/bin/java.exe</code>.
<br />
You can edit the RunMint.bat file so that it looks like this:<br />

<pre>@echo off
title Mint
"C:/Program Files/Java/jre7/bin/java.exe" -jar Mint4.0.jar
echo [Program Finished.]
pause</pre>

And now your mint programs should run properly.<br /><br />

<span class="section_title">More Code Examples</span><br />
To execute a Mint program that is not named program.mint, go to the command line and type:<br />

<pre>java -jar Mint.jar NAME_OF_FILE.mint</pre>

To execute NAME_OF_FILE.mint. Make sure you cd (change directory) into the folder that contains the Mint interpreter before doing so. This applies on any operating system.<br /><br />

Let's write some more code:<br />

<pre><span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="number">3</span><span class="number">0</span><span class="number">0</span>
<span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="number">3</span><span class="number">6</span> * (<span class="number">8</span> + <span class="number">1</span><span class="number">4</span>)
<span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">"My name is "</span> + <span class="string">"Alice."</span>
a = <span class="number">1</span><span class="number">0</span><span class="number">0</span> / <span class="number">3</span>
<span class="keyword">print</span> a
b = a + <span class="number">8</span><span class="number">7</span>
<span class="keyword">print</span> b</pre>

Mint can perform mathematical operations such as 36 * (8 + 14), where * means multiplication and + means addition. Text operations are also possible,
with + meaning 'combine these two pieces of text'.<br /><br />

You are also allowed to assign variables in Mint, using the format:<br />

<pre>&lt;name> = &lt;value></pre>

Which assigns the value &lt;value> to a variable named &lt;name>.<br /><br />

You can also use the keyword 'input' to allow the user to type in information:

<pre><span class="keyword">show</span> <span class="string">"Enter your name:"</span>
stuff = <span class="keyword">input</span>
<span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">"Your name is: "</span> + stuff</pre>

'show' is similar to print, except that it doesn't display a line break on the screen.<br /><br />

Comments are used to provide notes and useful info about code. The interpreter ignores all comments.<br />
There are two types of comments: line comments (that start with //) and block comments (that start with /* and end with */).<br />

<pre><span class="comment">//This is a line comment.

/* This is
a block comment */</span></pre>

Here's an image of what the interactive interpreter might look like.<br /><br />

If you have already replaced program.mint with your own code, you can find a copy of the code for the interactive interpreter in the file repl.mint.
